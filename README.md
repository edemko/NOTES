This folder will be accumulating notes.
Look under the `META` directory so see:
  - how the directory tree should be laid out
  - what kind if notes I especially want to accumulate
  - location of known notes

Distribution and syncing will be done through github.

## Maintenance

I've created a linter script stored under `META/scripts/lint.bash`.
It checks various conventions that this repository should abide by.
