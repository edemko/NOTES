# My Status

## 2023-06-02:

I've been using Sublime Text for a little over a decade now.
I've been using Vim competently (not elegantly) for server-side and little tasks for almost as long.
I have outgrown these.

As for Sublime, it's proprietary-ness has always annoyed me, and now it's nagging me for a "Key Upgrade".
So even though I paid for it, it's become nagware again; that was fine when I was 8 and playing video games,
  but I have standards now.
Also, while it is configurable, the documentation leaves something to be desired.
Perhaps there are gaps in the API as well, but I wouldn't know: the docs aren't especially discoverable.

As for Vim, it's a great editor!
The only complaint I have during day-to-day use is that (the way I use it) it's completely terminal-based.
Terminals have kinda broken keyboard input, and there's nothing a TUI Vim can do about that.
Also, while it is configurable (and I've got my setup pretty smooth with reasonably little work),
  any more configuration I do has to go through vimscript, which…
  I _really_ don't want to learn vimscript 😱

On the other hand, dependently-typed languages (Agda, Idris 2, Coq) all seem to lock themselves into Emacs.
Well, I want the power of dependent typing ,and while I _can_ work around the Emacs dependency, it's a hassle.
If I could be at least as competent at Emacs as I am at Vim,
  then I might bother to give those languages a real run for the money.
Also, Emacs is renowned for it's configurability, which is nice;
  it's also renowned for Emacs Lisp being the worst of all possible Lisps…
  but at least is isn't vimscript!
