This folder contains notes related to the everyday practice of programming.
  - Usage notes for common programming tools,
    especially when the documentation is cumbersome or lacking.
  - Notes I take while learning a new tool.
  - References to the community, ecosystem, and good practices.
  - My own philosophies about various topics.
  - Installation instructions (preferably executable).
    Don't forget instructions to inspect, update, and uninstall!

Many of these notes will be tool- or environment-specific,
  and so should be put under a folder naming the tool/environment.
Other notes may be more general-purpose,
  such as philosophy of and practices for mutable state.
